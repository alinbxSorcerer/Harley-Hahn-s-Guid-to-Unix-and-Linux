** Excerpt:
*** Personal Notes:
     1. An extension of your mind
     2. You are working with people who designed Unix (behind the computer)
     3. Yor are forging a mental relatioship with some of the smartest, most accomplished programmer.
** The Concepts:
   Within your Unix system, you do not exist.
   You log in as a particular userid, and you run programs to do your bidding.
   As a person who lives in the outside world, your role is limited to furnishing input and reading output.

** 01.Introduction
   - You are becoming a member of the global Unix community, the
     largest collection of smart people in the history of the world.
   - Second, using Unix will change how you think, and for the better.
   - Unix people like to read. In a world in which most people
     have trouble mustering up an attention span longer than ﬁve
     minutes, Unix people will actually read the manual when they have
     a problem.
** 02.What is Linux? What is Unix?
*** Summary
    It's a Operating System
    - Kernel + Utilities

*** 1.What is Operating System
    三个方面, 1
    ) Hardware 2) Software (furnish an environment) 3) User
    interface.
    program bring life. 这点说得震撼到了我的心底.
    The important idea I want you to appreciate is that computer
    systems are complex entities, created by a melding of 1) hardware,
    2) software, and 3) users. Since you are the user, you are affected by
    1)the hardware and 2) the software that you choose to use.

    1) Computers (machines) run programs in order to perform tasks for people
    and provide services to other programs.
    2) Programs bring life to what would otherwise be inert machines.
    3) People use computers for a large variety of purposes, including writing more programs to run on
    computers.

    1. To make efficient use of the hardware.
    2. To furnish an environment for software, offering resources to the various programs as they
   run.
    3. To provide an interface for users to interact with the software.
    4. To offer a variety of basic tools(useful program) for users.
*** 2.What is Kernel?
    - In this way, the kernel is constantly available to provide essential services as they are needed.
*** 3.Unix = Kernel + Utilities
*** 4."Unix" Used to be a specific name
*** 5."Unix" is now a generic name
*** 6.The Free Software Foundation
    Computer users should be free to modify programs to ﬁt their needs, and free to share software, because helping other people is the basis of society.” Stallman believed that programmers, by their nature, like to share their work and, when they do, everyone beneﬁts.
*** 7.Excerpts from the GNU Manifesto
    “I consider that the golden rule requires that if I like a program I must share it with other people who like it. Software sellers want to divide the users and conquer them, making each user agree not to share with others. I refuse to break solidarity with other users in this way. I cannot in good conscience sign a nondisclosure agreement or a software license agreement. For years I worked within the [MIT] Artiﬁcial Intelligence Lab to resist such tendencies and other inhospitalities, but eventually they had gone too far: I could not remain in an institution where such things are done for me against my will.

“So that I can continue to use computers without dishonor, I have decided to put together a sufﬁcient body of free software so that I will be able to get along without any software that is not free. I have resigned from the AI lab to deny MIT any legal excuse to prevent me from giving GNU away...

“Many programmers are unhappy about the commercialization of system software. It may enable them to make more money, but it requires them to feel in conﬂict with other programmers in general rather than feel as comrades. The fundamental act of friendship among programmers is the sharing of programs; marketing arrangements now typically used essentially forbid programmers to treat others as friends. The purchaser of software must choose between friendship and obeying the law. Naturally, many decide that friendship is more important. But those who believe in law often do not feel at ease with either choice. They become cynical and think that programming is just a way of making money...

“Copying all or parts of a program is as natural to a programmer as breathing, and as productive. It ought to be as free...

“In the long run, making programs free is a step toward the post-scarcity world, where nobody will have to work very hard just to make a living. People will be free to devote themselves to activities that are fun, such as programming, after spending the necessary ten hours a week on required tasks such as legislation, family counseling, robot repair and asteroid prospecting. There will be no need to be able to make a living from programming...”

*** Summary
    - Interface, Terminal + Host
    - Local Area Network
    - Client/Server
    - Text is all you need.
*** 1. Humans, Machines and Aliens
    - Interface and everything else;
    - Computer = Terminal + Host
    - Terminal = Input facility + output facility

    When we use tools that are designed primarily to be easy to learn, we end up with systems in which the computer is in control. When we use well-designed, powerful tools that take time to learn, we end up with systems in which the user is in control. That is the case with Unix.

** 23.The Unix Filesystem
*** 总结几点重要的收获:
    从file的定义出发.
    1. /proc/1111 is the process id
    2. mount /dev on /media
    3. Named
 Piples: mkfifo, IPC (Interproces Communication)
    4. Boot Process, boot devices filesystem
    5. The Virtual File System

*** Wiping out the Contents of a File: shred
    shred -fuvz datafile
    - Here then is the ultimate shred command. It will override
      existing ﬁle permissions, wipe out all the data by overwriting
      it many times, ﬁll the ﬁle with all zeros, and delete the
      remains:
*** The idear of link
    1. Unix set aside storage space on the disk to hold the file
    2. Unix look in the inode table and find a free inode, say#478515.
       fill in the information in the inode that pertains to the new file.
    3.Unix place an entry in the _bin_ directory.
      Entry contains the filename along with inumber of 478515
      Link connects a filename and the file itself.

    - Fork results in two identical processes.
      - Parent get a returned value of the newly created child
      - Child get a returned value which is set to 0.

*** 1.How The Kernel Manages Processes
*** 2.Forking Till you Die
    Kernel Porvide essential services to processes:
    - Memory Management
    - Process Management
    - Interprocess Communication(Local, network)
    - Input/Output(via device driver, program that perform actual communications with physcial devices
    - File Management
    - Security and access Control
    - Network Access(such TCP/IP)

    System Call
    - fork, wait, exec, kill
    - open, read, write, close
*** 3.Orphans and Abandoned Processes

*** 4.Distinguish Between Parent and Child
    - Parent get a RETURN VALUE of newly child process ID
    - child get a RETURNED VALUE of zero.

*** 5.The Very First Process: init

*** 6.Foreground and Background Processes
*** 7.Creating A Delay: sleep
    sleep 5; sleep 5s; sleep 5m; sleep 5h; sleep 5d
*** 8.Job Control,
    jobs, ps, fg, bg, suspend,
    - %%, current job
    - %+, current job
    - %-, previous job
    - %n, job#n
    - %name, job with specified command name
    - %?name, job with name anywhere within the command
*** 9.The ps Program: Basic Skills (Process Status)
    Options can be divided into three groups:
    - Unix
    - BSD
    - GNU-only
    Compare ls and ps
    - ls examine the inode table;
    - ps examine the process table 
